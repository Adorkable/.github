# Welcome to Adorkable's public project repositories!

To learn more about our small creative collective please visit our website [adorkable.io](https://adorkable.io)

On the other hand, on Github you'll find the repositories of a wide variety of projects and libraries we've built, both past and present

Notably:
* [Eunomia*](https://github.com/Adorkable?q=eunomia&type=all&language=&sort=) - our wide ranging general utility libraries in a variety of different languages and platforms
* [StreamingLibrary*](https://github.com/Adorkable?q=streaming&type=all&language=&sort=) - our project templates and libraries for setting up a real-time Unity (or anything really) controlled by multiple users playing or operating from a web browser 

You can also find some of the work we've done with other open source projects at [Github:Adorkable-forkable](https://github.com/Adorkable-forkable)
